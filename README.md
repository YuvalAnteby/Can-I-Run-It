**Can I Run It** is a full-stack web app that checks whether your PC can run a selected game based on your hardware
specs and desired settings.
<br>
This monorepo contains the backend (built with Python, FastAPI, MongoDB) and the frontend (JavaScript, React + MUI).

---

## üöß Project Status

> üõ†Ô∏è **Currently in active development**

- The backend is functional for local use during development.
- The database is private and not publicly seeded, so local testing requires coordination.
- Many planned features are being actively built.

## üåü Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented

- Core Functionality:
  - Hardware selectors (CPU, GPU, RAM)
  - Game cards with interactive details page 
  - Compatibility checker based on MongoDB performance data
- Backend:
  - FastAPI backend with documented routes (Swagger)
  - Unit tests and continuous integration with GitHub Actions
  - Dockerized setup for both local and production environments
